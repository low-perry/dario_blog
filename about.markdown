If my social media presence has ever spoken some truth about me, is that me and the "about me" sections, have been on a [philosophical conflict ]({{ '/blog/about-me' | relative_url }}) for as long as my digital footprint has existed. (My first one ever being \*describes who he is\* and the last one being "Why is it always Bios?")


My name is Dario.
