When crafting technical documentation, one of the most challenging decisions is determining how much detail to include. Too much depth, and you risk overwhelming your general audience; too little, and advanced users might find your content lacking. In this article, we'll explore strategies for striking that delicate balance, using real-world examples like the “Timeouts in inactive tabs” section from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), an integral part of the [`setTimeout()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/setTimeout) method documentation, and insights from [Chrome for Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/) as a case study.

## Understanding Your Audience

The first step in deciding how deep to dive is identifying your audience. Ask yourself:

- **Who are they?** 

Are your readers mainly beginners, intermediate developers, or experts looking for granular technical details?

- **What are their priorities?** 

Do they need a high-level overview to understand a concept, or do they crave in-depth explanations and advanced troubleshooting advice?

For example, the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/setTimeout#:~:text=Timeouts%20in%20inactive%20tabs) on timer behaviors is used by a wide range of developers. While seasoned professionals might be interested in the nuances of throttling mechanisms detailed in the [Chrome for Developers article](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/timer-throttling-in-chrome-88#terminology), the majority of visitors benefit from concise, clear summaries.

## Assessing the Complexity of the Subject

Not every topic requires an exhaustive breakdown. When dealing with technical details like JavaScript timer throttling, it’s essential to evaluate:

- **The inherent complexity:** 

Concepts such as minimal throttling, regular throttling, and intensive throttling introduce layers of complexity. The Chrome for Developers article outlines how these tiers work, but presenting everything might confuse users who are only trying to understand why their timers behave unexpectedly.

- **The relevance to the core functionality:** 

Does understanding these nuances significantly affect how developers use the API? Often, a quick note with a link to further reading is enough.

## Strategies for Balancing Detail and Clarity

Here are a few strategies you can consider:

### Tiered Documentation

Organize documentation into layers:

- **High-Level Overview:** 

Present only the critical points that most users need. For instance, note the default timeout behaviors (e.g., 1 second on desktops, 15 minutes on Firefox for Android) and mention exceptions like active audio contexts.

- **Advanced Sections:** 

Create expandable sections or dedicated pages for developers who want to understand the underlying throttling mechanics. Here, you can explain concepts like chained timers and how intensive throttling works in Chrome 88.

### Integrate Notes and Links

A brief note can acknowledge the existence of more complex behavior without overwhelming the reader:

- **Example:**

> **Note:** Recent updates in browsers, such as Chrome 88's intensive throttling of chained JavaScript timers, introduce additional nuances. See [Chrome for Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/timer-throttling-in-chrome-88#terminology) for in-depth details.

This approach allows interested users to explore further without cluttering the main text.

### Use Clear, Concise Language

Avoid jargon overload. Where technical terminology is necessary, provide definitions or tooltips that clarify their meaning. Techniques such as inline explanations or glossaries can be incredibly useful.

## Case Study: Timer Throttling in Inactive Tabs

To illustrate, consider the [MDN section](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/setTimeout#:~:text=Timeouts%20in%20inactive%20tabs) on "Timeouts in inactive tabs." The current content highlights basic behaviors:

- **Standard behavior:** 

Inactive tabs experience a minimum timeout delay (1 second on desktops, 15 minutes for Firefox on Android).

- **Audio exception:**

Tabs utilizing the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) with an active [AudioContext](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext) are exempt.

- **Tracking script throttling:**

Firefox applies stricter limits on known tracking scripts.

Now, compare this to the [Chrome article](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/timer-throttling-in-chrome-88#terminology) that details a layered approach:

- Minimal throttling applies when the page is visible or actively playing sound.
- Regular throttling kicks in for moderately inactive pages.
- Intensive throttling is enforced when pages have been hidden for extended periods, bundling timer events to conserve resources.

The advanced details are valuable but could overwhelm a reader just trying to understand why a timer might not behave as expected. The balance here might be to keep the MDN content simple and use a note to reference the Chrome article for advanced users.

## Conclusion

Deciding how deep to delve in your documentation ultimately depends on who you're writing for and what they need. By considering your audience’s expertise, assessing the subject’s complexity, and implementing tiered documentation strategies, you can create content that is both accessible and technically robust.
When in doubt, start with the basics and provide pathways to more detailed information. This way, your documentation remains approachable while still serving as a valuable resource for those who need deeper insights.

In our current discussion, we’re facing a similar decision regarding whether to incorporate all the nuances of timer throttling from Chrome's article into the MDN page. Reflecting on these strategies, it might be best to keep the main content concise and add a note with a link to the detailed article for users who wish to explore further.
