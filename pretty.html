<h2>Favorite Activities</h2>
<h3>Running</h3>
<p>
  I love running; it's my favorite way to get some exercise. I recently
  rediscovered this hobby and am currently running 5k in 35 minutes. My goal is
  to complete a half marathon by the end of the year.
</p>
<h3>Swimming</h3>
<p>
  I grew up in a coastal city at the meeting point of the Adriatic and Ionian
  seas. Swimming has always been an important part of my life.
</p>
<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>
  I love exploring a wide range of genres. While I mostly read
  fiction, I adore the classics. I also enjoy non-fiction, particularly topics
  on math and science. However, my greatest passion lies in poetry. I appreciate
  poetry across all genres, though I have a soft spot for French Symbolism,
  Surrealism, Dadaism, and Italian Hermeticism.

<h3>Playing Chess</h3>
<p>
  I started playing chess eight years ago and still approach it with the same
  enthusiasm. Itâ€™s a fantastic way for me to relax and keep my mind sharp.
</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>
  I am a casual gamer and enjoy metroidvania platformers and action roguelikes.
  My recent achievements include defeating the final boss in *Nine Sols* and
  completing *Slay the Spire* on Ascension 20.
